                <p>Formify is a simple signup form page that serves as a practical project for learning HTML, CSS, and
                    familiarizing oneself with the fundamental concepts of Git and GitHub. Through this repository, I
                    gained
                    valuable hands-on experience in version control, repository management, and collaboration techniques
                    using Git
                    and GitHub. Furthermore, I had the opportunity to explore the setup of a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub
                    Pages.</p>
                <p>By working on Formify, I deepened my understanding of web development, acquired essential skills in
                    using HTML
                    and CSS, and practiced using Git and GitHub effectively. This project allowed me to apply
                    theoretical knowledge
                    to a real-world scenario, fostering a practical and comprehensive learning experience.</p>

                <p>The Cat-App repository is a project that showcases a simple HTML page featuring cat photos, lists,
                    and a
                    submission form. The purpose of this project is to provide an interactive experience for users to
                    explore
                    cat-related content.</p>
                <p>Users can browse a gallery of cat photos and click on the provided link to see more. Two lists are
                    includedâ€”one
                    showcasing things that cats love and the other highlighting the top three things cats hate. Users
                    can also fill
                    out a form to submit their own cat photo, specifying whether their cat is indoor or outdoor and
                    indicating the
                    cat's personality.</p>

                <p>The Cafe Menu project is a simple HTML code that showcases a cafe menu with various coffee options
                    and their
                    corresponding prices. By exploring and working on this project, I have gained a better understanding
                    of HTML and
                    its elements. Through writing and structuring the HTML code for the cafe menu, I have learned how to
                    create
                    headings, lists, and sections to organize the content effectively. Additionally, I have practiced
                    using HTML
                    tags to display text, images, and links within the menu. This project has served as a hands-on
                    experience that
                    has deepened my knowledge and proficiency in HTML.</p>
                <p>Working on the Cafe Menu project has provided me with practical experience in web development using
                    HTML. It
                    has allowed me to apply the concepts and techniques learned in HTML to a real-world scenario. By
                    customizing and
                    modifying the code, I have enhanced my skills in HTML syntax, element manipulation, and styling.
                    This project
                    has been instrumental in honing my HTML abilities and has contributed significantly to my growth as
                    a web
                    developer.</p>
